This repository is my first attempt on a MERN application. I have been following the tutorial of FreeCodeCamp.org to complete this application.

The backend and frontend codes are present in their respective folders. 

Follow the steps to set up the application.

1. cd into the backend folder and do npm install and npm client-install. It will install dependencies for both backend and frontend.

2. Set up a cluster in Atlas or AWS and provide the connection string in the .env file in backend folder. 

3. By default backend will run on port 5000 and frontend will run on port 3000

4. While in the backend folder, execute npm run dev. It will automatically run both your frontend and backend scripts. 

Watch out for the readme updates...
